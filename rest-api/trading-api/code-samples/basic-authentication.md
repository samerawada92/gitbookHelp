                                              headers = {"Accept" : "application/json", "Et-App-Key" : self.EtAppKey, "Username":self.username, "Password":self.password})

        print('Authorization status code: ' + str(authenticationRequest.status_code) + '\n')

        try:
            responseJSON = authenticationRequest.json()
            print(responseJSON)
            self.token = "Bearer " + responseJSON["Token"]
            return responseJSON
        except:
            return "No response"

#Performing initial Authentication
sampleRequest = EtnaAPIRequest()
sampleRequest.initialAuth()
```
{% endcode %}

In this example, there's a class called `EtnaAPIRequest` that has five properties:

* `baseURL` — this is the URL that hosts your API. Each solution has its own base URL for both the Trader and the Developer API.
* `EtAppKey` — this is the unique key of your solution that can be retrieved from the BO companies widget in ETNA Trader.
* `Token` — this is the authentication token that must be provided in all API requests except for the first one \(authentication\).
* `Username` and `password` — these are the credentials of a user on whose behalf all API requests will be made.

The first method — `initialAuth` — creates a POST request to the base URL appended by `token` \(each endpoint has its own unique address\). As for headers, the authentication endpoint requires you to provide the following parameters:

* `"Accept" : "application/json"`— use this parameter to accept the authorization token that will be returned in response to this request.
* `EtAppKey` — use this parameter to identify your app in all requests.
* `Username` and `password` — these are the credentials of the user on whose behalf all subsequent requests will be made.

In response to this request, you'll receive a JSON file that contains the token \(provided that all the parameters were correctly specified\):

```javascript
{'State': 'Succeeded', 'Token': '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'}
```

You can then extract the returned token and assign it to the `token` property.

## CURL

The following is a sample CURL for performing single-factor authentication:

```text
curl -X POST "https://pub-api-et-demo-prod.etnasoft.us/api/token" \
    -H "Username: yourUsername" \
    -H "Password: yourPassword" \
    -H "Et-App-Key: yourEttAppKey" \
    -H "Content-Length: 0"
```
