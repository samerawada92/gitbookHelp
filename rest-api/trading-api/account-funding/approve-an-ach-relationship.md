# Approve an ACH Relationship

## Overview

This POST endpoint enables you to approve a new ACH relationship that are based on micro deposits \(as opposed to Plaid-based ACH relationships\). When you attempt to create such relationship, you will see two values in your banking account statement \(e.g., `0.34` and `0.21`\). These two values will have to provided in this endpoint to confirm the creation of the ACH relationship.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This endpoint cannot be used for approving Plaid-based ACH relationships, as they are automatically approved.
{% endhint %}
