# Get All ACH Relationships

## Overview

This GET endpoint enables you to retrieve information about all ACH relationships of a particular trading account.

There are five required parameters that must be provided in the request:

1. **Et-App-Key** \(header\). This is the unique key of your app that identifies your app when communicating with our service. Contact your administrator to get this key.
2. **Authorization** \(header\). This is the authorization token from the very first [token request](../authentication/).
3. **API version** \(path\). Unless necessary, leave it at "1.0".
4. **accountId** \(path\). This is the [internal identifier](../user-accounts/list-users-accounts/) of the trading account in ETNA Trader whose ACH relationships must be listed.
5. **pageNumber** \(query\). This is the number of the page \(all ACH relationships are split in pages\).
6. **pageSize** \(query\). This is the preferable size of the page \(maximum value is 99\).
7. **sortField** \(query\). This is a parameter by which all returned ACH relationships must be sorted.
8. **desc** \(query\). This boolean parameter indicates if the returned ACH relationships should be sorted in ascending \(false\) or descending \(true\) order.

Here's the final template for this API request:

```text
GET apiURL/v1.0/accounts/{accountId}/ach-relationships/
```
