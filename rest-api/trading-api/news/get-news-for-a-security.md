# Get News for a Security

## Introduction

This GET endpoint enables you to fetch the list of all recent news for a specific security by providing its ticker symbol.

There are four required parameters that must be provided in the request:

1. **Et-App-Key** \(header\). This is the unique key of your app that identifies your app when communicating with our service. Contact your administrator to get this key.
2. **Authorization** \(header\). This is the authorization token from the very first [token request](../authentication/requesting-tokens/).
3. **API version** \(path\). Unless necessary, leave it at "1.0".
4. **symbol** \(query\). This is the ticker symbol of the security for which the news must be fetched.

Here's the final template for this API request:

```text
GET apiURL/v1.0/news?symbol=AAPL
```

## Response

In response to this API request, you'll receive a JSON file containing the list of the recent news for the specified security.

    "Content": "In a less favorable market, however, bond fund investors could get hurt—not so much by worsening fundamentals, but the funds’ difficulty to meet redemptions in an illiquid market.  As much as 50% of the assets in high-yield bond funds and 15% of assets of all fixed-income funds could be vulnerable to a liquidity shortfall in the event of heavy investor redemptions.  “There are more risks to open-end bond funds than people are willing to acknowledge,” says Mark Grant, chief global strategist B.

## Common Mistakes

Here are some of the common mistakes that developers make when attempting to retrieve the news for a specific security.

### Failing to Specify the Et-App-Key Parameter

If you specify the wrong Et-App-Key parameter or fail to include it in the header altogether, you'll get the following error:

```javascript
{
    "error": "Application key is not defined or does not exist"
}
```

### Failing to Specify the Query Parameters

It's crucial to understand that the _**security**_ parameter must be provided in the request; otherwise you'll receive the 404 status code.
