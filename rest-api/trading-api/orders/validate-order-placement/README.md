# Verify Order Placement

## Overview

This POST endpoint enables you to verify an order before placing it in ETNA Trader. This might be useful for ensuring that the user has properly constructed an order and prevent any issues related with defective orders.

There are five required parameters that must be provided in the request:

1. **Et-App-Key** \(header\). This is the unique key of your app that identifies your app when communicating with our service. Contact your administrator to get this key.
2. **Authorization** \(header\). This is the authorization token from the very first [token request](../../authentication/).
3. **API version** \(path\). Unless necessary, leave it at "1.0".
4. **Trading Account ID** \(path\). This is the numeric ID of the trading account on which an existing order replacement must be verified.
5. **placeParams** \(body\). This is a JSON file that contains the parameters of a new order that must be verified.

Here's the final template for this API request:

* For orders that will only be verified by the API but not the execution venue \(quick\):

```text
POST apiURL/v1.0/accounts/{accountID}/preview/orders
```

* For orders that will be verified by the API and the execution venue too \(slow\):

```text
POST apiURL/v1.0/accounts/{accountID}/preview/syncorders
```

## Request Body

The body of this request represents the information of the new order that must be verified before you can proceed to place it. The order must be sent in the JSON format with mandatory parameters about the order as follows:

  "TrailingStopAmount" : 10,
}
```

### One-Triggers-the-Other Order Verification Type

One-Triggers-the-Other is a type of conditional order in which execution of one order automatically triggers the other one. Each of the two orders has to be provided as a separate leg:

```javascript
{
    "Type": "OneTriggerOther", //the type of the order
        "Symbol": "", //this parameter must be empty
        "Legs": [{ //the array of two legs
            "Symbol": "AAPL", //the first leg
            "Type": "Limit",
            "Price": 150,
            "Side": "Buy",
            "Quantity": 100
        },
        {
            "Symbol": "TSLA", //the second leg
            "Type": "Limit",
            "Price": 100,
            "Side": "Buy",
            "Quantity": 100
        }
    ]
}
```

In this case, if the limit order to purchase the Apple stock gets executed, the second limit order to purchase the Tesla stock will automatically be triggered.

{% hint style="warning" %}
In One-Triggers-the-Other orders, the first leg cannot be a market order.
{% endhint %}

### One-Cancels-the-Other Order Verification Type

One-Cancels-the-Other is a type of conditional order in which execution of one order automatically cancels the other one. Each of the two orders has to be provided as a separate leg:

```javascript
{
    "Type": "OneCancelOther", //the type of the order
        "Symbol": "", //this parameter must be empty
        "Legs": [{ //the array of two legs
            "Symbol": "AAPL", //the first leg
            "Type": "Limit",
            "Price": 150,
            "Side": "Buy",
            "Quantity": 100
        },
        {
            "Symbol": "TSLA", //the second leg
            "Type": "Limit",
            "Price": 100,
            "Side": "Buy",
            "Quantity": 100
        }
    ]
}
```

In this case, if the limit order to purchase the Apple stock gets executed, the second limit order to purchase the Tesla stock will automatically be cancelled.

{% hint style="warning" %}
In One-Cancels-the-Other orders, both legs cannot be market orders.
{% endhint %}

### One-Triggers-OCO Order Verification Type

One-Triggers-OCO is a type of conditional order in which execution of one order triggers execution of a One-Cancels-the-Other order. This order type is useful in strategies where you purchase a security \(trigger\) and then automatically configure a stop-loss and a take-profit order \(OCO\). The first order — the trigger — is provided as the first leg while the OCO order is provided as the second and the third legs.

```javascript
{
    "Type": "OneTriggerOneCancelOther",
    "Symbol": "", //this parameter must be empty
    "Legs": [{
            "Symbol": "AAPL", //the trigger order — the first leg
            "Type": "Limit",
            "Side": "Buy",
            "Price": 190,
            "Quantity": 100
        },
        {
            "Symbol": "AAPL", //the first leg of the OCO order 
            "Type": "Limit",
            "Price": 200,
            "Side": "Sell",
            "Quantity": 100
        },
        {
            "Symbol": "AAPL", //the second leg of the OCO order 
            "Type": "Stop",
            "StopPrice": 189,
            "Side": "Sell",
            "Quantity": 100
        }
    ]
}
```

## Response

In response to this request, you'll receive a JSON file confirming \(or rejecting\) that the new order has been properly constructed.

```javascript
{
  "IsSuccessful": true,
  "Commission": 1.00000001,
  "Commissions": {
    "Per Trade Commission": 1,
    "Per Contract Commission": 1e-8
  },
  "Cost": 238,
  "NetCost": 239.00000001,
  "TotalCost": 1.00000001,
  "Quotes": [
    {

      "Bid": 266.61,
      "Last": 266.5,
      "Volume": 50,

## Common Mistakes

Here are some of the common mistakes that developers make when attempting to verify a new order.

### Failing to Specify the Et-App-Key Parameter

If you specify the wrong Et-App-Key parameter or fail to include it in the header altogether, you'll get the following error:

```javascript
{
    "error": "Application key is not defined or does not exist"
}
```

### Providing an Incorrect Set of Parameters

Another common mistake made when sending this API request is failing to provide all mandatory parameters. Doing so will result in the 500 status code and the following error message:

```javascript
{
  "message": "An error occurred while processing your request",
  "error": "Unexpected server error"
}
```

### Placing Orders Whose Value Exceeds the Account's Buying Power

When attempting to verify an order whose value exceeds the trading account's buying power, you'll receive a JSON file with the `ErrorDescription` parameter equaling `DayTradingBuyingPowerExceeded`.

```javascript
{
  "IsSuccessful": false,
  "ErrorDescription": "DayTradingBuyingPowerExceeded",
  "ErrorDescriptionArgs": [],
  "Commission": 3.75,
  "Commissions": {
    "Per Trade Commission": 3.75
  },
  "Cost": 1766790,
  "NetCost": 1766786.25,
  "Quotes": [
    {
      "Ask": 196.31,
      "Bid": 196.28,
      "Last": 196.29,
      "Volume": 200,
      "OpenInterest": 0
    }
  ],
  "MarginChange": 0
}
```

### Failing to Specify the Limit Price for Limit Orders

An attempt to verify a limit order without specifying its price will result in an error; in response you'll receive a JSON file with the `ErrorDescription` parameter equaling `QuotePriceIsInvalid`.

```javascript
{
  "IsSuccessful": false,
  "ErrorDescription": "QuotePriceIsInvalid",
  "Commission": 0,
  "Commissions": {},
  "Cost": 0,
  "NetCost": 0,
  "MarginChange": 0
}
```

### Failing to Specify the Stop Price for Stop-Loss Orders

An attempt to verify a stop-loss order without specifying its price will result in an error; in response you'll receive a JSON file with the `ErrorDescription` parameter equaling `QuotePriceIsInvalid`.

```javascript
{
  "IsSuccessful": false,
  "ErrorDescription": "QuotePriceIsInvalid",
  "Commission": 0,
  "Commissions": {},
  "Cost": 0,
  "NetCost": 0,
  "MarginChange": 0
}
```
