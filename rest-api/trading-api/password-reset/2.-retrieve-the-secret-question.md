# 2. Retrieve the Secret Question

## Introduction

Depending on the configuration of your company, users may either be forced to specify a secret question-answer pair during registration or not. If a user does not have to answer the secret question, this step might be skipped and you can proceed to the [third step](2.-generate-a-token-for-a-new-password.md). If the user does need to answer the question, use this endpoint to retrieve the question and then go back to the endpoint from the [first step](1.-reset-traders-password.md) to provide the answer.

There are three required parameters that must be provided in the request:

1. **Et-App-Key** \(header\). This is the unique key of your app that identifies your app when communicating with our service. Contact your administrator to get this key.
2. **API version** \(path\). Unless necessary, leave it at "1.0".
3. **username** \(query\). This is the login or the email of the user whose password ought to be reset.

Here's the final template for this API request:

```text
GET apiURL/v1.0/users/password/secret-question?username=hello%40etnatrader.com
```

## Response

In response to this request, you will receive a JSON object containing the secret question:

```javascript
{
  "Model": "What street did you live on in third grade?",
  "Errors": [],
  "IsSucceed": true
}
```

You may then display this question to the user and prompt them to specify the answer. Next, provide their answer as the value for the `SecretQuestionAnswer` key in the request body of the [first step](1.-reset-traders-password.md). Afterward you can proceed to the [third step](2.-generate-a-token-for-a-new-password.md).

## Common Mistakes

Here are some of the common mistakes that developers make when attempting to retrieve a user's secret question.

### Failing to Specify the Et-App-Key Parameter

If you specify the wrong Et-App-Key parameter or fail to include it in the header altogether, you'll get the following error:

```javascript
{
    "error": "Application key is not defined or does not exist"
}
```
