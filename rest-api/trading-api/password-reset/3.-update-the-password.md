# 4. Update the Password

## Introduction

This PUT endpoint is the final step of the password reset process.

There are three required parameters that must be provided in the request:

1. **Et-App-Key** \(header\). This is the unique key of your app that identifies your app when communicating with our service. Contact your administrator to get this key.
2. **API version** \(path\). Unless necessary, leave it at "1.0".
3. **resource** \(body\). This is a JSON file that contains the the token from the previous step as well as the new password.

### Request Body

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Token | This is the token returned in the [previous endpoint](2.-generate-a-token-for-a-new-password.md). |
| Password | This is the new password of the trader. |
| PasswordConfirmation | This is the new password of the trader \(must be identical to `Password`\). |

```javascript
{
  "Token": "someToken-bd26-825db0",
  "Password": "pkof394f34kf934f03u4fj0",
  "PasswordConfirmation": "pkof394f34kf934f03u4fj0"
}
```

Here's the final template for this API request:

```text
PUT apiURL/v1.0/users/passwords/reset/
```

## Response

In response to this API request, you will receive a JSON file either confirming successful token generation or enumerating errors that occurred in the process.

```javascript
{
  "Errors": [],
  "IsSucceed": true
}
```

At this point the password has been successfully reset, and the trader may proceed to log into ETNA Trade using the new password.

## Common Mistakes

Here are some of the common mistakes that developers make when attempting to reset a trader's password.

### Failing to Specify the Et-App-Key Parameter

If you specify the wrong Et-App-Key parameter or fail to include it in the header altogether, you'll get the following error:

```javascript
{
    "error": "Application key is not defined or does not exist"
}
```
