# Get User's Trading Settings

## Overview

This GET endpoint enables you to request a user's default trading

settings by providing their unique identifier in the header. In response, you'll receive a JSON file with the user's information.

There are four required parameters that must be provided in the request:

1. **Et-App-Key** \(header\). This is the unique key of your app that identifies your app when communicating with our service. Contact your administrator to get this key.
2. **Authorization** \(header\). This is the authorization token from the very first [token request](../authentication/requesting-tokens/).
3. **userID** \(path\). This is the internal ID of the user  whose settings you'd like to retrieve. If you're sending the request on behalf of the user whose authorization token is used to perform the request, set this parameter to `@me`.
4. **API version** \(path\). Unless necessary, leave it at "1.0".

The user information request must be sent to the following URL:

```text
GET apiURL/v1.0/users/{userID}/settings/trading
```

## Common Mistakes

Here are some of the common mistakes that developers make when requesting a user's trading settings:

### Failing to Specify the Et-App-Key Parameter

If you specify the wrong Et-App-Key parameter or fail to include it in the header altogether, you'll get the following error:

```javascript
{
    "error": "Application key is not defined or does not exist"
}
```
