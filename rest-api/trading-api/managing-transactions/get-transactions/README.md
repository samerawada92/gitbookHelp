# Get Transactions

## Overview

This GET endpoint enables you to retrieve a list of transactions that the have been made on a particular trading account. The number of retrieved transactions can be specified in the request header.

There are eight required parameters that must be provided in the request:

1. **Et-App-Key** \(header\). This is the unique key of your app that identifies your app when communicating with our service. Contact your administrator to get this key.
2. **Authorization** \(header\). This is the authorization token from the very first [token request](../../authentication/requesting-tokens/).
3. **API version** \(path\). Unless necessary, leave it at "1.0".
4. **accountId** \(query\). This is the ID of the trading account whose transactions need to be retrieved.
5. **pageSize** \(query\). This field indicates the number of transactions that needs to be retrieved per page.
6. **pageNumber** \(query\). This field indicates the number of the page that needs to be retrieved \(all transactions are split into a set of pages that can be loaded one by one\).
7. **sortBy** \(query\). This is the field by which the retrieved transactions ought to be sorted. For example, if you the value of this parameter is set to **Quantity**, the retrieved alerts will be sorted by the number of shares involved in the transaction.
8. **isDesc** \(query\). This field indicates if the list of retrieved transactions should be sorted in the descending order \(true\) or ascending order \(false\).

There's also one optional parameter worth examining:

* filter \(request query\). This is an SQL query used to retrieve only those transactions that satisfy the conditions of the query. 

### Filter Syntax

The syntax for filter queries is rather simple: each parameter of a transaction can serve as a filter. The conditions that a parameter needs to satisfy can be expressed in the following ways:

1. **Parameter** \(=, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=\) **value**. For example: `SecurityId = 4`
2. **Parameter** \(=, contains, startsWith, endsWith\) **string**. For example: `Date >= #2019-03-18T11:10:14.036Z#`
3. **Parameter** in \(**value1**, **value2**, etc.\). In this case the parameter has to be contained in the set of values in the parentheses to satisfy the filter condition. For example: `Id in (7420, 7630, 9870)`
4. **Parameter** between **Value1** and **Value2**. In this case the parameter has to be in the specified range between Value1 and Value2 to satisfy the filter condition. For example: `Quantity between 0 and 1000`.

Boolean values are provided in the following format: `true` and `false`.

Numeric values are provided in the regular format: `2500`.

Strings must be highlighted with quotation marks: `'USD'`.

Dates must be highlighted with the pound sign: `#2019-08-09T18:31:42#`.

The following table lists a set of sample queries:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:left">Sample Query</th>
      <th style="text-align:left">Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

      <td style="text-align:left">

        </ul>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <ul>
          <li>Retrieves all transactions that were carried out prior to the specified
            date.</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <ul>
          <li>Quantity between 0 and 1000</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <ul>
          <li>Retrieves all transactions in which the number of transacted securities
            lies in the range between 0 and 1000.</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that you can combine different queries to create more complex requests:

* SecurityId = 4 and Quantity between 0 and 1000
{% endhint %}

Here's the final template for this API request:

```text
GET apiURL/v1.0/accounts/6303/transactions/?pageNumber=0&pageSize=10&sortBy=Quantity&isDesc=true
```

## Common Mistakes

Here are some of the common mistakes that developers make when attempting to retrieve the list of transactions made on a particular trading account.

### Failing to Specify the Et-App-Key Parameter

If you specify the wrong Et-App-Key parameter or fail to include it in the header altogether, you'll get the following error:

```javascript
{
    "error": "Application key is not defined or does not exist"
}
```

### Failing to Specify the Query Parameters

It's crucial to understand that the _**pageSize, pageNumber, isDesc, and sortBy**_ parameters must be provided in the request; otherwise you'll receive the 404 status code and the following message:

```javascript
{
    "Error": {
        "Code": "UnsupportedApiVersion",
        "Message": "The requested resource with API version '1.0' does not support HTTP method 'GET'."
    }
}
```
