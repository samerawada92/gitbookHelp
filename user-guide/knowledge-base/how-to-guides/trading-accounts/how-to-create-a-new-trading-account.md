# How to Create a New Trading Account

## Introduction

From time to time traders need to create a new trading account to test a new strategy or reset their current trading account. A new trading account will have an initial deposit, no orders and no positions, thereby enabling the trader to start anew.

ETNA Trader enables traders to own several trading accounts.

## Creating a New Trading Account

To create a new trading account, navigate to ETNA Trader Web. In the header, expand the drop-down menu containing the list of your trading accounts and click **Edit**.
