# App Layout

## Introduction

Once you launch ETNA Trader for iOS, you'll notice that the app's layout is based on a five-tab bar, each tab containing a separate screen with its own purpose. The list of tabs in the bar is as follows:

1. **Quotes**. This screen displays the current \(or the closing price\) price for securities in a specific watchlist. 
2. **Positions**. This screens displays the trader's current positions.
3. **Orders**. This screen displays all active, completed, and rejected orders of the trading account.
4. **Price Alerts**. The screen displays all price alerts of the trading account.
5. **Account**. This screen contains information about the trading account as well as the app's settings.
