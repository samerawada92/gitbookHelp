# Orders View

## Introduction

The third tab of ETNA Trader for iOS — **Orders** — is responsible for displaying the list of current orders of the current trading account: outstanding orders, filled orders, rejected, orders, etc. Here you can quickly inspect which of your orders have already been filled and which ones are under review or were rejected.

{% hint style="info" %}
The number of the trading account is displayed in the navigation bar under the _Orders_ label.
{% endhint %}

The layout of the tab represents a four-segment view that sorts all orders by their status:

1. **All**. This segment lists all orders of the current trading account.

1. **Filled**. This segment displays only filled orders.

## Orders Tab Layout

The Orders tab lists all orders of the specified trading account. Looking closer at each order you can view the following information about the order:

* The **ticker symbol** of the order's underlying security;
* The current **Mark** price of the security;
* The transaction **type** \(Buy, Sell, Sell Short, Buy to cover\);
* The **number of securities** transacted in this order;
* The **type of the order** \(Market, Limit, Stop Limit, etc.\);
* The **time** at which the order was placed;
* **Order status** \(New, Filled, Cancelled, etc.\).

At the bottom of the screen there's a pull-up statistics view that gives you a visual breakdown of the number of active, filled, and cancelled orders along with their their corresponding percentage of all orders.

Swiping left, you'll see a more detailed breakdown of all orders by types. On the right, each order type will be represented by an Apple Watch-style circle showing the weight of the type in the whole.

If you tap on the little ellipsis button in the upper right-hand corner, you can place a similar order or an opposite order. The opposite order is an order with the reverse side; for example, if the initial order's was to purchase 100 shares of Apple, its opposite counterpart would be to sell 100 shares of Apple.
