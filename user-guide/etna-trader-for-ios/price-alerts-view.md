# Price Alerts View

## Introduction

The fourth tab of ETNA Trader for iOS — **Price Alerts** — is responsible for displaying the trader's price alerts. A price alert is a scheduled notification that will go off when the specified target price is reached for a specific security. For example, if you want to be notified when the price of the Netflix stock reaches $500, you can create a price alert for the stock with the following condition: `>= 500`.

Price alerts are shared between all platforms of ETNA Trader, meaning all alerts created in the mobile apps will function in the web terminal and vice versa.

## Creating a New Price Alert

To create a new price alert, tap on the **Quick Alert** textfield.

Next, search for the required security and then tap on it. You will be prompted with the alert creation view where you need to specify the following parameters:

1. **Reference price**. This is the price that will be pitted against the target price. Possible values: **Last**, **Bid**, **Ask**.
2. **Alert condition**. This is the condition of the price alert. Possible values: **≥** \(greater than or equal to\), **≤** \(less than or equal to\).
3. **Price**. This is the target price of the price alert. Once this price is reached, the price alert will go off.
4. **Expiration Date**. This is the date on which the price alert will expire.

In addition to native iOS notifications, you can also get price alerts by Email and SMS. Notification settings for price alerts can be configured in the app's settings. Go to **Account** \(5th tab\) and tap on the little gear icon in the top-left corner.
