# Mutual Funds Trade Ticket

## Introduction

Mutual funds are a popular investment vehicle for investors who wish to delegate the responsibility for management of their funds to a group of professional investment managers that run said mutual funds. The nature of mutual funds somewhat differentiates them from stocks and bonds that can simply be purchased and sold on the exchange. Specifically, mutual funds can be exchanged or liquidated, the dividends received by the mutual fund from its holdings can be further reinvested or distributed back to the stockholder, etc. For this reason TTG-SIM Trader contains separate user interfaces for trading of mutual funds both in TTG-SIM Trader Web and in TTG-SIM Trader for iOS and Android; and in this article we'll demonstrate the process in detail.

## Mutual Funds Trading in TTG-SIM Trader Web

In TTG-SIM Trader Web, trading of mutual funds transpires on the \_\_**Mutual Funds Trade Ticket** widget. This widget is responsible for purchasing, selling, exchanging, and liquidating of mutual funds. Here a trader can also indicate if they would like to reinvest dividends and capital gains.

### Purchasing Mutual Funds

If you navigate to the **Orders** widget, you will notice the newly placed order with the **New** status. It's likely that the order will not be immediately executed since mutual fund orders are usually executed after-hours.
