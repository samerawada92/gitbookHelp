# Wire Transfers

## Withdrawing Funds Using Wire Transfers

In addition to ACH transfers and check transfers, the TTG-SIM also provides traders with the ability to withdraw funds from their trading accounts by means of wire transfers. Specifically, the funds could be withdrawn via either a domestic wire or a foreign wire.

Check transfers are relevant only for withdrawing funds.
{% endhint %}

To withdraw funds using wire transfers, select **Wire Transfer** on the **Funds Transfer** tab. Next, specify the amount to be withdrawn \(in USD\). If you would like to withdraw all funds altogether and close the account, select the **Total distribution and close account** checkbox.

Alternatively, you can withdraw your funds via a foreign wire by selecting the **Foreign Wire** radio button. Whereas domestic wire transfers cost $25, foreign wires cost $50.

Optionally, you can make a **For Further Credit** payment by selecting the corresponding checkbox at the bottom. In this case you will also have to specify additional information about the intermediary bank.

Once you're done, click **Submit**, and the transfer will be passed to an administrator for review. Once it's approved, withdrawal of funds will be initiated.
