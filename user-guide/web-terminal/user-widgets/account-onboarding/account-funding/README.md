# Account Funding

## Introduction

Once you have created a new trading account and it has been approved by your administrator and the clearing firm, the next step is to deposit funds into the account in order to start trading. TTG-SIM Trader provides traders with three ways to deposit to and withdraw funds from their trading accounts: ACH transfers, wire transfers, and check requests.
